# Education and Early Rabbinic Training

## 📝 Summary

Rabbi Paul’s journey through higher Jewish education spanned continents and ideological shifts—from postwar Paris to traditional yeshiva study in Chicago, and finally to rabbinic ordination at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. Along the way, he encountered cultural diversity, antisemitism, and social activism, all of which profoundly shaped his identity as a spiritual leader who bridged Torah with modern thought.

- He did not pick up the swiftly French language and absorbed the rich tapestry of postwar European life, since he hated the atmosphere in a French school where the kids were not allowed to walk with their hands in their pockets which was the American way and was considered by the French as not proper. He preferred going to the American school in Paris. 
- First direct exposure to postwar Jewish recovery in Europe and broader cosmopolitan life.
