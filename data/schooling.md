## 🔍 Key Details

### 📚 Early Schooling in Denver
Paul began his formal education at **Colfax Elementary School** in Denver, Colorado, graduating in **May 1946**. That same summer, he attended **Camp Masad** in the Pocono Mountains, where he was first immersed in the Hebrew language—a key milestone in his Jewish identity.

He continued to **Lake Junior High School** that fall, where he remained through the 9th grade. This period was marked by a close connection to the Jewish community in Denver, culminating in his **Bar Mitzvah** on **August 16, 1947**—an event he described as a deeply public rite of passage, likening his upbringing to “living in a fishbowl.”

### ✈️ A European Turning Point
In **1948**, Paul traveled to Europe and Israel with his family. His father, Rabbi Manuel Laderman Z"L, was sent by the Joint Distribution Committee to work with Jewish refugees in **postwar Paris**. During this time, Paul briefly attended a French school but found the cultural environment too rigid—particularly disliking rules such as not being allowed to walk with hands in pockets.

He soon transferred to the **American Community School** in Paris in **November 1948**, where he felt more at ease. The journey exposed him to cities like **Brussels**, **Geneva**, **Rome**, **Athens**, and **Jerusalem**, leaving a lasting impression and deepening his Zionist convictions.

### 🎓 High School Years
Upon returning to the U.S., Paul entered **North High School** in Denver for 10th grade (**1949**), before transferring to the **Chicago Jewish Academy** for 11th and 12th grades (**1950–1952**). There, he graduated as **Valedictory Speaker**, a role that reflected both his intellectual promise and growing leadership within the Jewish academic world.

### 🏛️ Higher Education and Rabbinic Studies
In **1952**, Paul simultaneously enrolled in the **University of Chicago**, where he studied liberal arts and philosophy, and the **Hebrew Theological College (HTC)** for yeshiva studies—both on a full scholarship.

Seeking a deeper integration of secular and religious scholarship, he transferred in **1955** to **Yeshiva University** in New York. He graduated in **1957** with a **B.A. in English Literature** from Yeshiva College, and then embarked on rabbinic training.

### 📖 Rabbinic Formation
Paul began his advanced rabbinic studies at **Mercaz HaRav Kook** in **Jerusalem** in **1957**, an institution known for its commitment to religious Zionism and Torah scholarship. A year later, he returned to New York to complete his studies at **Yeshiva University**.

In **June 1960**, Paul received his **Rabbinic Ordination (Smicha)** from the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, conferred by leading scholars **Rabbi Dr. Joseph B. Soloveitchik** and **Rabbi Dr. Samuel Belkin**. This ordination marked the culmination of a lifelong commitment to both faith and intellectual excellence.
