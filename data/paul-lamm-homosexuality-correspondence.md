# Correspondence with Rabbi Norman Lamm on Homosexuality (1972‚Äì1973)

## üìù Summary

This private letter exchange between Rabbi Paul S. Laderman and Rabbi Norman Lamm provides a rare, candid view into how Orthodox rabbis grappled with emerging LGBTQ realities on Jewish college campuses in the 1970s. Paul sought advice on how to relate to a group of gay Jewish men at Berkeley Hillel, questioning Halachic boundaries and institutional acceptance. Lamm responded by reaffirming traditional prohibitions, but also admitted that full exclusion may not be warranted. Paul's tone is reflective, empathetic, and courageous in addressing a deeply sensitive issue.
