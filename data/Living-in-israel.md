## 🔍 Key Details

### Humor and National Spirit
- Rabbi Paul began his speech with a joke about God informing world leaders that the world would end in two weeks, highlighting Israel’s tendency to argue endlessly — even in apocalyptic times.
- The audience responded with laughter and applause, illustrating Israel’s mix of tension and resilience.

### A Country of Passion and Drama
- Describes Israel as “a land of pain and passion.”
- Notes that daily life is intense and sometimes overwhelming.

> “Most of the time the meetings of the Knesset are more exciting than the meetings of the American Congress.”

> “Perhaps it would be easier to wait in the Diaspora until the Messiah comes in His own time… But I disagree.”

### Community and Involvement
- Emphasizes the deep interconnectedness of Israeli society.

> “It’s a country where everyone counts, everyone cares, everyone is involved in everyone else’s life.”

- Everyday crises — bomb scares, emergencies, hospital rides — engage entire communities.

### Political and Media Critique
- Acknowledges deep political divides in Israel.

> “We live in a very charged society. The media and the extremists feed off each other for their own reasons.”

- Criticizes international media for focusing on extremist figures like Rabbi Meir Kahane and ignoring mainstream Israelis.

> “They’re always tripping over the television cables wherever we go. They are fascinated by us. I just wish they would face us also when they report the news.”

> “I am sick and tired of ‘anti-Zionist Jews.’ They are not representative of the vast majority of the people.”

### Hope, Challenge, and Compromise
- Notes that *“Six-Day War thinking still prevails.”*
- While affirming Israel’s legitimacy, calls for compromise — but only if Palestinians recognize Israel’s right to exist.

> “If they cannot come to compromise, there will be no Middle East solution.”

### An Emotional Encounter
- Recalls crying after Arab residents declined to promise to stop demonstrations in exchange for reduced security patrols.

> “They had lost an opportunity. We had lost an opportunity.”

### The Spiritual Core

> “Israel itself has not lost the hope that we will indeed become a kingdom of priests and a holy nation, a light unto the nations.”

- Urges American Jews to remain engaged with Israel, even in difficult times.

### A Personal Memory
- First visited Israel in 1949 at age 14 during Passover.
- Got lost in Tel Aviv but was comforted by a policeman.

> “The policeman said to me: ‘You’re not lost. You’re at home, living in Israel.’”
