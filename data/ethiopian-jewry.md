## 🔍 Key Details

- Rabbi Paul moved to Israel in 1973, previously serving as Hillel director at UC Berkeley and as an Orthodox rabbi in Oakland.
- Since January 1985, he has been the Israel director for the American Association for Ethiopian Jews (AAEJ).

> “Three years ago they were living in the bush. We brought them here, put some of them in hotels, served them three meals a day. They became acculturated much more quickly.”

> “First you’re talking about saving lives. Take them out of the bush, or they’ll be dead.”

### Historic Significance
- Rabbi Paul sees the Ethiopian aliyah as one of three major Jewish events since the Holocaust:
  1. Founding of the State of Israel  
  2. Reunification of Jerusalem  
  3. Immigration of Ethiopian Jews

> “They’re totally outside our realm of historical perspective. It destroys every historical category we’ve ever had.”

> “I’m overwhelmed by the fascination.”

### Suffering and Trauma
- Many Ethiopian Jews walked for days under threat of military attack to reach airlift sites.
- Thousands died en route; survivors carry lasting trauma, especially children in Youth Aliyah villages.

> “They went through a holocaust to get here.”

> “How do you live with that? How can they go see a movie, play soccer, eat ice cream with their mothers starving?”

### Identity and Integration
- Some Ethiopian Jews tattooed crosses on their foreheads to avoid Christian missionary targeting.
- Rabbi Paul challenges the skepticism from some rabbinic authorities over their Jewishness.

> “We’ve lost nine-tenths of our people, and now you question whether we’re Jews?”

- Notes growing integration, including intermarriage and increased academic engagement.

> “Look what can happen. A year ago, he probably didn’t know how to use a fork.”

> “If I can help to give a man some sense of human dignity… what greater mitzvah is there?”
