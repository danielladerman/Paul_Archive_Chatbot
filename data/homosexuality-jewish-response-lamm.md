## üîç Key Details

### Context and Trigger
- Reacts to liberal Christian documents such as the 1966 British Council of Churches‚Äô ‚ÄúSex and Morality.‚Äù
- Comments on a 1967 meeting of 90 Episcopal priests questioning the immorality of homosexual acts.

### Jewish Legal and Scriptural Framework
- Cites Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13; identifies male homosexual acts as *toevah* (abomination).
- Considers this prohibition universal under Noahide law.
- Draws from biblical stories (Sodom, Potiphar‚Äôs wife) and rabbinic sources.

### Rabbinic History and Interpretations
- Notes that Jewish tradition views homosexuality as rare and unnatural.
- Discusses leniencies on sleeping arrangements versus strictures on sexual acts.
- Explores interpretations of ‚Äútoevah‚Äù from rational (frustrating procreation) to mystical (repugnance beyond reason).

### Ethical and Social Implications
- Urges compassion without moral compromise, similar to Halachic treatment of suicide.
- Warns against conflating affection with moral acceptability.
- Criticizes Christianity‚Äôs move toward moral relativism as a theological breakdown.
