# Denver Childhood - Perspective

## 📝 Summary
Paul Laderman was born on August 23, 1934, in Denver, Colorado. While his early years were defined by his role as the son of a prominent modern Orthodox rabbi withouut a beard, his childhood was also marked by early medical struggles, a rebellious social streak, and the unique cultural isolation of Denver’s "West End." Rather than a simple story of tradition, his formative years were a complex "fishbowl" experience where he balanced community expectations with a desire for American normalcy.

## 🔍 Key Details & Corrections

### Birth and Early Health
- **Medical "Miracle":** Born prematurely at **6 pounds, 9 ounces**, Paul was a sickly infant. At 10 months old, he required blood transfusions, intravenous feeding, and an oxygen tent. Doctors initially feared he would be a lifelong cripple, later calling his recovery a miracle.
- **The Move:** At age three, Paul’s family moved into their permanent home in Denver. The house included his father’s extensive basement library and a ping-pong playroom.

### Family Background
- **Father’s Origins:** Rabbi Manuel (Manny) Laderman was raised in **Chicago**, not Colorado. He was ordained at the **Hebrew Theological College (HTC)** at age 23 and moved to Denver for his first pulpit.
- **Mother’s Origins:** Bess Laderman was born in **Russia** in 1911 and immigrated to **Kansas City** at age 12. Paul joked she was so Americanized it was as if she had been born at 12 in Kansas.
- **Ancestry:** The family hailed from **Nemirov, Ukraine**, having survived the pogroms of **1648** and **1921**. A family legend claims their escape was aided by an ancestor's famed vodka brewing, which earned them a warning from the local police chief.

### The "West End" Community
- **Elementary School:** Attended **Colfax Grammar School**, where **98%** of students were Jewish.
- **Junior High:** Transitioned to **Lake Junior High**, with a diverse population: ~1/3 Jewish, 1/3 Italian, and 1/3 WASP.
- **Cultural Identity:** Paul described the West End as a “self-imposed ghetto” and his “Jerusalem in America.”

### Personality and Social Life
- **The "Naughty" Son:** Despite a scholarly home, Paul was not bookish. He led pranks, including altering Christmas carol lyrics to vulgar versions.
- **The Fishbowl Effect:** Felt under constant scrutiny due to his father’s dual status as a PhD and rabbi. This created a tension between his public image and private autonomy.
- **Sibling Dynamics:** Sister **Mierle** was born on **September 25, 1939** (9 lbs, 3 oz). Paul was initially disappointed she wasn’t a boy, and even jokingly tried to give her away to neighbors while out walking her.
