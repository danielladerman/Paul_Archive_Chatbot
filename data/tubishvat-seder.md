# Tu Bishvat Seder

## üìù Summary

This document presents an original Tu Bishvat seder developed by Rabbi Paul. It blends mystical tradition, ecological consciousness, and educational storytelling into a ritual meal featuring symbolic fruits and wines. The seder is divided into four stages‚ÄîAsiyah, Yetzirah, Briah, and Atzilut‚Äîmirroring the kabbalistic worlds, and includes blessings, Torah verses, Midrashim, and meditative reflections.

   * Discussion on Israel as a vineyard and spiritual resilience.
3. **Briah (Creation)** ‚Äì Equal white and red wine

   * Fruits with inedible pits/seeds (e.g. olives, dates).

4. **Atzilut (Emanation)** ‚Äì Red wine only
