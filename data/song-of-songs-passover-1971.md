# The Greatest Love Story Ever Told – Annotated Compilation

## 📝 Summary

This expanded 8th-day Passover sermon, delivered by Rabbi Paul in 1971, presents the *Song of Songs* (*Shir Hashirim*) as the deepest spiritual love poem in the Bible. He draws from classical Jewish sources—Midrash, Targum, Rashi, and Alshich—to explore allegorical meanings connecting the text to the Exodus, Israel's exile, divine yearning, and the human quest for redemption.
