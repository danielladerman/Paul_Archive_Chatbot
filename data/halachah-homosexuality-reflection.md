# Halachah & Homosexuality: A Personal Reflection

## üìù Summary

This brief essay, found in Rabbi Paul‚Äôs archive and possibly written by him, expresses concern over the alienation of homosexual Jews from the religious community. While upholding Halachic prohibitions, it suggests that Jewish tradition allows for greater compassion and inclusion than contemporary social hostility reflects. The document introduces a correspondence with Rabbi Norman Lamm and advocates for a less ostracizing approach within Halachic boundaries.
