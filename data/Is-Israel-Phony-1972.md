## 🔍 Key Details

- Event took place at Temple Beth Abraham in Oakland, during a press conference with Congressman Ron Dellums.
- Dellums, a progressive African-American representative, was addressing concerns about his record on Israel.

### Rabbi Paul's Position

  - The statement said: *“Dellums has long proven himself a friend and supporter of Israel.”*
- However, after Dellums addressed a 1971 petition supporting Israel's right to purchase Phantom jets — which he hadn’t signed — Laderman called Dellums' answers “phony.”

> “I worked on it.” — Rabbi Paul, when asked about authorship of the pro-Dellums statement  
> “I will repudiate this, but Dellums can’t — he needs the black vote.” — Rabbi Paul on anti-Israel rhetoric from the Black Panther press

### The Controversy
- Dellums did not repudiate inflammatory anti-Israel content in the *Black Panther* newspaper, citing free speech protections under the 14th Amendment.
- One notable quote from the *Panther* press:  
  > *“The Zionist Fascist State of Israel is a puppet and lackey of the imperialists and must be smashed.”*

### Dellums' Defense and Political Back-and-Forth
- Dellums advocated for open negotiations:  
  > “There should be face-to-face deliberations among the Arabs, Israel and the Palestinians.”
- When asked who should represent the Palestinians:  
  > “That’s up to them.”

- He also explained that his votes on foreign aid bills were influenced by package deals that included other nations, such as Greece.

- Dellums clashed with his GOP opponent, Peter Hannaford, accusing him of exploiting racial divisions:  
  > “Racism — in trying to pit me against Jews, my opponent has used demagogy, distortion, outright lies and backstabbing!”
