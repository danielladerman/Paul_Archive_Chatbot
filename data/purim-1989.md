## 🔍 Key Details

### Surface Celebration vs. Hidden Depth
- Purim is commonly seen as a festive masquerade, with laughter, costumes, and drama.
- Beneath the surface lies a tale of survival, political intrigue, and existential threat to the Jewish community.

### Themes from the Megillah
- The Jews of Shushan live comfortably—until sudden anti-Semitic decrees endanger them.
- The story unfolds through a chain of ironic “coincidences,” such as:
  - Mordecai overhearing a plot
  - The king’s insomnia
  - Haman’s poorly timed arrival
  - Esther’s strategic bravery

### Hidden Hand of Providence
- God’s name is not mentioned in the Megillah—divine action is masked.
- The story reflects how salvation can come through natural, seemingly random events.
