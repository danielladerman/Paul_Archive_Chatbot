# Rabbi Talking of Compromise on West Bank

## 📝 Summary
In this 1988 interview, Rabbi Paul Laderman advocates for a religiously grounded approach to peace amid the First Intifada.

## 🔍 Key Details

### Rabbi Paul and Oz Veshalom
- Rabbi Paul Laderman is the educational director of Oz Veshalom, a religious Israeli peace organization.
- The group's name comes from Psalm 29:11 — *“The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will give his people peace.”*
- Represents a religious counterpoint to hardline groups like Gush Emunim and the Kach party.
- Promotes *dialogue, restraint,* and *religious pluralism*.

> “We believe that given the proper circumstances — that is, if there’s a [Palestinian] partner to talk to — that territorial compromise is not a dirty word.”

### Perspective on Compromise
- Cites Judaism’s highest value: preservation of life (*pikuach nefesh*).
- Frames compromise as a religious imperative, not a political weakness.
- Acknowledges demographic and strategic realities of the Middle East.

> “To preserve Jewish life and Arab life, it’s necessary to talk about territorial compromise.”

> “We’ve got to make an accommodation.”

### Intifada Context
- Written during the early First Intifada, amid intense violence in the territories.
- Rabbi Paul shares a personal story about his son in the army uprooting fruit trees — an act forbidden in the Bible.

> “In the Bible there’s a specific prohibition against tearing up fruit trees. My son and all the other soldiers were crying as they did this.”

### Challenges and Risks
- Oz Veshalom maintains quiet contacts with Palestinian leaders, names withheld for their protection.
- Notes a deterioration of relations with Palestinian neighbors since the uprising began.

> “Our relations with our neighbors have been very friendly, right up until December. Now the situation is very taut — primarily because they are afraid.”

### U.S. Speaking Tour
- Reached out to Jewish communities across the U.S., including Atlanta.
- Found American Jews deeply divided and emotionally affected by televised images of the uprising.

> “They’ve been fascinated or terrified or traumatized or shocked.”
