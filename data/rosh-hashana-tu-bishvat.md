# Rosh Hashana and Tu Bishvat Reflections

## üìù Summary

This holiday reflection explores the multiple meanings of Rosh Hashana in Jewish tradition, especially Tu Bishvat‚Äîthe New Year for Trees. Rabbi Paul artfully blends halachic commentary, mystical traditions from Zefat, and modern Israeli symbolism. The sermon includes a creative Tu Bishvat seder with layered wine symbolism, fruit categories aligned with kabbalistic worlds, and stories linking ancient and modern Jewish heroes to the land and its trees.
