### Abraham and Yocheved Kalis Family (Paul's Great Aunt)

Introduction:
Fannie (Faiga) Menzalis Paul's Grandmother's sister Yocheved (Eve) married to Abraham Kalis and lived in Chicago IL. Paul's Great Aunt and Uncle. Yocheved and Abraham Kalis had 4 girls: Bessie Kalis Savner, Ida (Chaike) Kalis Siskel, Freida Kalis Rubin, Mae Kalis Gray and 1 boy: Jack Kalis. They were all Paul's first Cousins once removed.

Manuel Laderman was adopted by them when he moved to Chicago with his father William after Eve's sister's passed away in New York. Manuel was Eve's sole nephew from Fannie (Faiga) Menzalis. Manuel grew up with Eve's and Abraham's children who were close in his age as brothers and sisters. Manuel was most close to Mae and her husband Joe Gray. Mae and Joe, by all of Manuel's family throughout their life, we called Aunt Mae and Uncle Joe. They were always a close part of Manuel Laderman's life and Paul Laderman's family.

When Paul studied High School in Chicago and continued his early College and Rabbinical studies, he continued his father's close family relationship with the Kalis family and their children. They were all second cousins to him but since his father was treated by them as their brother, it created a very close family relationship. This bond continues until this day between the third and fourth generation of the Laderman and the Kalis family.

Paul always welcomed the members of the Kalis family and all relatives from his Paternal side and Maternal side when they visited in Israel and passed on this appreciation and love to his children for his extended family. Since Paul's immediate family was very small and intimate, Paul emphasized to his children this important kinship of our families. Our families continue its closeness to this very day three and four generations later.
