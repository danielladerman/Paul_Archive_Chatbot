# Among the Canaanites: The Berkeley Experience of Open Hillel

## üìù Summary
Rabbi Paul Laderman reflects on his transformative tenure as Hillel director at UC Berkeley from 1971 to 1973. Amidst the social upheaval of the early 1970s, he fostered a pluralistic and ideologically diverse Jewish student community, an "Open Hillel," in stark contrast to later institutional guidelines. His narrative connects personal influences, campus events, and broader ideological tensions within American Jewry and Zionism.

## üîç Key Details

### Influences and Philosophy
- Inspired by Maurice Pekarsky, former Hillel director at University of Chicago, known for his openness and compassion for "Canaanites"‚Äîa metaphor for ideologically diverse and culturally radical Jews.
- Rabbi Paul aligned more with inclusive philosophies (like Martin Federman's) than restrictive Hillel guidelines later endorsed by Eric Fingerhut.
- Questioned whether figures like the early Israeli "Canaanites" would have passed modern Hillel's speaker restrictions.

### Berkeley Hillel: 1971‚Äì1973
- Took the Hillel director post in 1971 after serving as rabbi at Beth Jacob in Oakland.
- First student council meeting ended with its unanimous dissolution‚Äîan unorthodox but symbolic start to student-led Jewish engagement.
- Embraced a decentralized model: Hillel was likened to a bicycle wheel with independent spokes.
- Major groups: Radical Jewish Union (RJU), Israel Student Organization (ISO), and many others with varying ideologies.

### Activism and Events
- Responded to UCLA Hillel's protest plans against Ronald Reagan with a Berkeley demonstration:
  - Students picketed the Israeli Consulate in San Francisco.
  - Awarded the Consul General the satirical ‚ÄúGolden Calf Award.‚Äù
- Welcomed controversial or unconventional figures:
  - Meir Kahane was invited (but canceled due to a court date).
  - Jews for Jesus were permitted to participate with a no-proselytizing condition.

### Institutional Support and Constraints
- National Hillel (Bnai Brith) was supportive despite discomfort among local and regional Federations.
- Faced tension due to reliance on Oakland‚Äôs smaller Jewish Federation for funding, rather than larger federations in San Francisco or Los Angeles.

### Broader Perspective and Reflections
- The 1970s lacked today's polarized debates (e.g., BDS, Palestinian speakers).
- Argues for open discourse as a tool to deepen Jewish identity and connection to Israel‚Äîeven among critical voices.
- Many radical students from that era eventually made aliyah and contributed significantly to Israeli society.
- Felt supported nationally but constrained regionally.
