# The Greatest Love Story Ever Told

## 📝 Summary

In this 8th day Passover sermon from 1971, Rabbi Paul reflects on the profound religious significance of the *Song of Songs*, traditionally read during Passover. He explores its allegorical interpretations, its spiritual centrality in Jewish tradition, and its depiction of the loving, sometimes anguished relationship between God and Israel. Through commentary from Targum, Rashi, Alshich, and Midrash Rabbah, he portrays the *Song of Songs* as an epic narrative of divine longing, national identity, and spiritual redemption.
