# Binding Up the Wounds of the Intifada  
*Rabbi Paul Laderman and Rabbis for Human Rights Confront Moral Challenges in Israel*

## 📝 Summary
Rabbi Paul Laderman, together with colleagues in Rabbis for Human Rights, sought to bring Torah’s prophetic voice into the moral chaos of the intifada. Crossing denominational lines, he emphasized coexistence, compassion, and Jewish responsibility — even when it meant controversy. His work in Palestinian villages, and the enduring image of him holding an Arab child, embodied his conviction that Judaism demands solidarity with the suffering.

## 🔍 Key Details

### Rooted in a Life of Activism
- Son of Rabbi Emanuel Laderman, deeply engaged in Denver Jewish life.  
- Served as rabbi of Beth Jacob Congregation in Oakland, then Hillel director at UC Berkeley (1971–1973).  
- Made aliyah with wife Shula and their children in 1973.  

> “I think that I found my soul on the Berkeley campus… One of the reasons I came on aliyah in 1973 was out of a belief that nations and Jewish ethics go hand in hand.”

### Rabbis for Human Rights Watch (RHRW)
- Brought together ~80 rabbis from Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform streams.  
- Formed to address moral and spiritual wounds caused by the intifada.  
- Mission included:  
  - Raising Jewish consciousness about human rights violations  
  - Expressing solidarity with the humiliated and dispossessed  
  - Alleviating suffering, especially of children needing medical care  
  - Critiquing abuses of power  
  - Reminding Israelis that Jewish law forbids standing idly by while others suffer  

> “Judaism must be connected to morality and justice. Otherwise, we are just preserving ritual and missing the heart of Torah.”

### Visit to Nablus and Beita
- Rabbi Paul and Rabbi Jeremy Milgrom visited Al-Ittihad Hospital (Nablus) and Beita, site of a deadly settler–villager confrontation.  
- Debated whether to wear kippot in Nablus; Paul put his kippah on an Arab child’s head as a gesture of care.  
- Shocked by lack of medical infrastructure.  

> “There’s too much blood around… Israeli authorities must act.”

### Facing Accusations
- Criticized as traitors and naïve sympathizers.  
- Rabbi Paul rejected such attacks:  

> “When you say ‘my country right or wrong,’ that’s being a traitor.”  

> “Maybe we are being taken in. But if I’m helping people in a tough situation, it doesn’t matter. If there’s an injustice, I want to resolve it.”

### Prophetic Tradition as Compass
- Grounded his activism in Torah values.  

> “The language of the prophets is the language of the people living here.”  

- Cited *darkhei shalom* (paths of peace):  

> “You do all kinds of things in order to live in peace with your non-Jewish neighbor. That’s Torah.”

### Hope Beyond the Barricades
- Advocated self-determination for Palestinians.  

> “It means we have to compromise on the biblical vision. We will have to let the majority who live in the territories have self-determination.”  

- Saw coexistence as inevitable.  

> “I think it will end when we recognize that living in Israel means living with Arabs.”  

- Stressed the need to maintain hope:  

> “We have to give our people hope that there is something to hope for.”

### Symbolic Image
- A widely circulated photograph showed Rabbi Paul holding an Arab baby in Beita, smiling gently as villagers looked on.  
- Became a symbol of compassionate Judaism confronting political conflict.

### Theological Anchor
- Connected Jewish historical memory to present suffering.  

> “We are living through a radical political exercise. God took us out of Egypt so we could learn how to respond to the suffering of others. We’ve been involved with that ever since.”
